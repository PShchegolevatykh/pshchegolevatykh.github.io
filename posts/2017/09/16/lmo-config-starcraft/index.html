                    <h4>Optimizing Logitech Mini Optical Mouse for StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II</h4>
                    <p>First, I would like to mention that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-930732-0403-Mini-Optical-Mouse/dp/B00006HMPF">Logitech Mouse Optical (M-UV55A)</a>                        is my current mouse of choice. I have small hands, and it has a perfect shape for my fingertip grip.
                        What works for me might not work for others though. Be careful. I tried many different mice before
                        such as Razer Krait, Razer Salmosa (both Asian and EU versions), Razer Abyssus, Logitech G303, Logitech
                        G102, Logitech G1. They were all good but not perfect.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img data-caption="Logitech Mouse Optical with other mice" src="images/lmo-with-other-mice.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>So I ended up getting the used ASUS version of LMO (silver color on the picture). Although the shape of LMO is fine, its 400 DPI sensor
                        can be a huge problem in modern games. Fortunately, there are some ways to improve the in-game experience.</p>
                    <h5>You can't avoid software scaling</h5>
                    <p>By scaling here I mean software adjustment of mouse sensitivity so the cursor moves faster. Ideally,
                        you would not want to have any software scaling. It's better to leave the built-in mouse DPI settings
                        as they are so the cursor would run smoothly without any pixel skipping. For example, if you set
                        the cursor speed higher than normal (i.e. higher than 6/11 in Windows Settings or 50% in StarCraft)
                        and move the mouse slowly you'll see that the cursor jumps over some pixels. Generally, it's a bad
                        thing to have in the game.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, LMO is an old 400 DPI mouse. It was fine to use it without any scaling on 640x480 or even
                        800x600 resolution screens. Now it's not the case anymore when you would usually have a 24-inch 1920x1080
                        monitor or even bigger. Without any scaling, the mouse cursor becomes painfully slow. This might
                        be still acceptable for FPS games, but certainly not for RTS like StarCraft when you need to hit
                        the opposite corners of the screen quickly. So software scaling for this mouse is a must, but how
                        to scale things properly?</p>
                    <h5>StarCraft: Remastered</h5>
                    <p>In SC: R Blizzard added a very useful option just for that called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/6sbfb8/tabulated_equivalent_bw_119remastered_use_mouse/">Use Mouse Scaling</a>.
                        According to the table below you must set the in-game sensitivity to 50% (no initial scaling) and
                        turn on this checkbox.</p>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>Let me explain why it just works. Assuming you have a 1080p resolution. This setting would automatically
                        set your sensitivity to 75% behind the scenes so it would feel like having 50% (no scaling) on an
                        480p screen.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img data-caption="Use Mouse Scaling Setting in Starcraft: Remastered" src="images/use-mouse-scaling.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>The LMO was designed for 480p screen, so "Use Mouse Scaling" would give you (almost) the same in-game
                        experience while playing on a bigger screen. In other words, it would automatically scale mouse sensitivity
                        to the appropriate value to "fake" the 640x480 screen experience. I believe this setting was introduced
                        for compatibility with the original Brood War resolution.</p>
                    <p>This also means that mouse scaling setting would work well ONLY with low DPI mice. Any modern 1000+ DPI
                        mice would feel insanely fast with this option turned on. With modern sensors, you don't need any
                        software scaling at all.</p>
                    <h5>Windows</h5>
                    <p>The above-mentioned approach only works in StarCraft: Remastered. When you leave the game, your mouse
                        reverts to the slow motion again. Isn't that annoying? Do wish you had the same scaling checkbox
                        for windows sensitivity? The conversion table helps here as well.</p>
                    <p>According to the table, you should set the sensitivity to 75% for 1920x1080 screen, 80% for a 1200p screen,
                        etc. Let's just open the Mouse Settings in Control Panel and set it just like that.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img data-caption="Windows Mouse Settings" src="images/windows-mouse-settings.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>I was actually surprised that it would not allow you to configure things as you might want to. For example,
                        there was no 75% option. It would get you either 70% (8/11) or 80% (9/11). Fortunately, the Windows
                        API itself provides you with more options. You can set mouse sensitivity values from 1 to 20 with
                        increments of 1 where 10/20 means no scaling or 50%. That's good news! If WinAPI has it I could write
                        a software to adjust those settings myself.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img data-caption="Extended Mouse Settings" src="images/extended-mouse-settings.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>So I did just that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj9d6huknelm7ne/ExtendedMouseSettings.zip?dl=0">Download Extended Mouse Settings App</a>

                    </p>
                    <p>Windows will most likely prevent you from running the app. It is not a virus. It needs admin rights
                        to be able to write to Windows Registry. It's not enough to just set the value through Windows API.
                        It's a three-step process. First, you set the sensitivity value you need, then you must save it to
                        the registry for the current user so it won't be reverted when Windows checks the registry value
                        again. If you don't want a sluggish experience on the Login screen you should apply the setting to
                        all users (also through Windows Registry). That's the third step.</p>
                    <p><strong>Update: </strong> there was software available to do the same things and many more.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Thanks to our unknown reader for mentioning that.</p>
                    <h5>Starcraft II</h5>
                    <p>This is very simple. You just set the in-game sensitivity to whatever value you need according to the
                        table (e.g. 75% for 1080p). It's easy and flexible already.</p>
                    <h5>Bonus 1: Set the "perfect" DPI for modern mouse</h5>
                    <p>You can estimate the DPI you need to set on any modern mouse for your screen resolution. First, let's
                        assume that 400 DPI is a perfect setting for 640x480 screen. Then for a higher resolution, you compute
                        a multiplier. For example, if you have 1280x1024 you compute it like so 1280 / 640 = 2. Then you
                        adjust the DPI accordingly: 400 x 2 = 800 DPI. For 1920x1080 it would be 400 x (1920 / 640) = 1200
                        DPI. Doing such adjustments, the experience would be the same regardless of the new screen size.
                        Pretty simple. You can also set 800x600 at 400 DPI as your starting point and redo the math. This
                        is not a rough science. Feel free to adjust for yourself. I found it more comfortable to play on ~1000 DPI having
                        a 1080p screen.</p>
                    <h5>Bonus 2: I can't get an LMO mouse anywhere</h5>
                    <p>You might consider some alternatives. For example, there's a <a href="http://www.commatech.cn/a/chanpinzhongxin/GamingMouse/2016/0517/48.html">Commatech Fkmini v3</a>                        mouse that has the same LMO shape with modern Avago 3090 sensor. I just ordered one from <a href="https://www.taobao.com/">Taobao</a>                        and waiting for it to come. Let me know if anyone needs a review of it later. There's also a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zowie-MICO-Mouse-Mac-2-ways/dp/B00518C8CY">ZOWIE Mico</a>                        and <a href="http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=957396416">SkyDigital NKEY G007</a>.
                        Both have a very close shape. ZOWIE Mico is almost impossible to get anywhere just like the LMO.</p>
                    <p>The most important thing is always your own comfort. If you like the mouse then stick with it.
                        Have fun in the game!</p>
